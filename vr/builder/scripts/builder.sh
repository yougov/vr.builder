# This script builds apps using buildpacks.

# It accepts two command line arguments:
# 1. The location of the application to be built.
# 2. The location of the folder where build assets may be cached.

# Additionally, ONE of either the BUILDPACK_DIRS or BUILDPACK_DIR environment
# variables must be set.

# BUILDPACK_DIR, if provided, should be the path to the buildpack to be used to
# build this app.

# If BUILDPACK_DIR is not provided, then BUILDPACK_DIRS will be used to set it.
# BUILDPACK_DIRS should be a list of buildpack directories, joined with the
# colon (":") character (just like PATH).  The buildpack to use when building
# the app will be selected by running each buildpack's "detect" script on the
# app until one of the buildpacks succeeds at detecting the app.  If no
# buildpack detects the app, the script will exit immediately.

# Once the buildpack has been determined, the script will call the buildpack's
# "compile" script, passing in the application and cache dirs.

# After compilation has finished, the script will run the buildpack's "release"
# script and write the output to <app dir>/.release.yaml
